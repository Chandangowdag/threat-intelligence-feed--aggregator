# Threat Intelligence Feed Aggregator

## Overview

The Threat Intelligence Feed Aggregator is a comprehensive cybersecurity platform designed to collect, analyze, and present threat intelligence from multiple sources. This AI-powered tool automatically aggregates security feeds, extracts Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and provides actionable intelligence through an intuitive web interface.

## Key Features

### Automated Feed Collection
The system automatically collects threat intelligence from curated RSS and Atom feeds, including major security sources such as US-CERT CISA, SANS Internet Storm Center, Krebs on Security, Malware Bytes Labs, and Threat Post.

### AI-Powered Analysis
Each threat intelligence item undergoes AI-powered analysis to generate summaries, assess severity levels, and extract relevant tags. The system categorizes threats by type and provides actionable insights for security professionals.

### Advanced IOC Extraction
The platform automatically extracts various types of Indicators of Compromise from threat intelligence content, including IP addresses, domain names, file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256), URLs, email addresses, CVE identifiers, and file paths.

### Real-Time Dashboard
The web-based dashboard provides real-time statistics and visualizations of threat intelligence, including severity distributions, IOC counts, and recent threat activity.

### Search and Export Capabilities
Users can search through collected threat data using keywords and export IOCs in multiple formats (JSON, CSV) for integration with other security tools and workflows.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**ThreatIntelItem**: A structured data model that represents individual threat intelligence items with comprehensive metadata including IOCs, severity assessments, and AI-generated summaries.

**IOCExtractor**: A regex-based engine that identifies and extracts various types of indicators from threat intelligence content while filtering out common false positives.

**ThreatIntelDatabase**: A SQLite-based storage system that manages threat intelligence data with efficient querying capabilities and automated indexing.

**FeedCollector**: A multi-threaded feed collection engine that fetches and processes RSS/Atom feeds from multiple sources simultaneously.

**AIAnalyzer**: An analysis engine that provides threat summarization, severity assessment, and tag extraction capabilities.

**ThreatIntelAggregator**: The main coordination layer that orchestrates all system components and provides the primary API interface.

### Technology Stack

The application is built using Python with several key libraries. The backend utilizes SQLite for data storage, feedparser for RSS/Atom feed processing, and requests for HTTP communications. The web interface is powered by Gradio, providing an interactive dashboard for threat intelligence visualization and management.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. The application has been tested with Python 3.8 and above for optimal performance.

### Installation Steps

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Install the required dependencies using the provided requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The system will automatically create the necessary database structure on first run, so no additional database setup is required.

### Running the Application

Launch the application by executing the main Python file:

```bash
python main.py
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:7860` by default. The application automatically launches with sharing enabled for remote access if needed.

## Usage Guide

### Dashboard Operation

The main dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of threat intelligence activity. Users can view real-time statistics including total threats, severity distributions, and IOC counts. The refresh functionality allows for manual updates of threat feeds, while the system also performs automatic background updates.

### Search Functionality

The search interface enables users to query threat intelligence data using keywords, CVE identifiers, domain names, or any other relevant terms. Search results are presented with full context including AI-generated summaries and extracted IOCs.

### IOC Export

The export functionality allows users to extract all collected IOCs in either JSON or CSV format. This feature is particularly useful for integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, threat hunting tools, and incident response workflows.

## Data Sources

The system currently aggregates threat intelligence from several authoritative sources:

**US-CERT CISA**: Official cybersecurity advisories from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, providing government-sourced threat intelligence and security guidance.

**SANS Internet Storm Center**: Real-time threat intelligence and security analysis from the SANS Institute, featuring expert analysis of current cyber threats.

**Krebs on Security**: Independent security journalism and threat intelligence from renowned security researcher Brian Krebs.

**Malware Bytes Labs**: Threat intelligence and malware analysis from Malware Bytes security researchers.

**Threat Post**: Enterprise security news and threat intelligence from Kaspersky's security publication.

## Configuration and Customization

### Adding New Feed Sources

The system is designed to be extensible with new threat intelligence sources. Additional RSS or Atom feeds can be added by modifying the `default_feeds` configuration in the `FeedCollector` class. Each feed source requires a name, URL, and type specification.

### IOC Pattern Customization

The IOC extraction patterns can be customized by modifying the regex patterns in the `IOCExtractor` class. This allows for adaptation to specific organizational needs or the addition of new indicator types.

### AI Analysis Enhancement

The current implementation includes a mock AI analyzer that can be replaced with integration to Large Language Models such as Ollama, OpenAI, or other AI services for enhanced threat analysis capabilities.

## Integration Capabilities

### SIEM Integration

The IOC export functionality facilitates integration with Security Information and Event Management platforms. Exported indicators can be imported into SIEM systems for automated threat detection and correlation.

### API Extension

The modular architecture allows for easy extension with REST API endpoints for programmatic access to threat intelligence data and system functions.

### Threat Hunting Workflows

The search and export capabilities support threat hunting activities by providing structured access to threat intelligence data and IOCs for proactive security investigations.

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation

The system implements comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all external data sources to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

### Access Control

The web interface should be deployed behind appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms in production environments to restrict access to authorized security personnel.

### Network Security

Consider implementing network-level controls such as firewalls and VPNs to protect the application when deployed in production environments.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Feed Collection Failures**: Network connectivity issues or changes to source feed URLs may cause collection failures. Check the application logs for specific error messages and verify network connectivity to source feeds.

**Database Errors**: SQLite database issues may occur due to permission problems or disk space constraints. Ensure the application has write permissions to the database directory and sufficient disk space.

**Performance Issues**: Large datasets may impact performance. Consider implementing database optimization techniques or pagination for improved response times.

### Logging and Monitoring

The application includes comprehensive logging functionality that records feed collection activities, errors, and system status. Monitor the application logs for troubleshooting and performance optimization.

## Contributing

### Development Environment

Set up a development environment by installing the requirements and running the application in debug mode. The modular architecture facilitates easy development and testing of individual components.

### Code Quality

Maintain code quality by following Python best practices, implementing comprehensive error handling, and adding appropriate documentation for new features.

### Testing

Implement unit tests for new functionality, particularly for IOC extraction patterns and data processing components.
